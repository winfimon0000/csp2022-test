      <h1> Labs are one of the most popular dog breeds in the world. Many families have had success bringing them into their homes, even with other dogs.
    <h2> I got black lab puppy when she was around 3 months. Shes super playful and really cuddly as well. I have two other dogs and she gets along with them great and they got used to her fast.

    <h22> But she is a high enegry dog who needs constant attention all the time. Not only is she high energy she also needs to be challgened mentally once in awhile.
